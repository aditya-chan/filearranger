# filearranger
## python3 script to rearrange and organize a folder according to file types.

_This script is the love child of OCD and laziness, **it is not meant to be used beyond the scope
of an individual's need to rearrange files on his or her personal computer.**_

This script uses python's os and sys modules to arrange the following files.

* code files
* compressed files
* documents
* images
* music files
* torrent files
* video files
