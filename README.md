# filearranger
## python3 script to rearrange and organize a folder according to file types.

**Currently the script is in development but it is usable**

_This script is the love child of OCD and laziness, **it is not meant to be used beyond the scope
of an individual's need to rearrange files on their personal computer.**_


This script is a command line utility and uses python's os and argparse modules to arrange the following files.

* code files
* compressed files
* documents
* images
* music files
* torrent files
* video files

Usage:
Takes path of the folder to be arranged as an optional argument, if no input is provided the script rearranges the files in the current directory
